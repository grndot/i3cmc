#### *

* You will see the name of the coin/token as written.

* Some names of coins and tokens differ from those provided by the site search (for example: [DAI](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/multi-collateral-dai/)), use the postfix name from the site address (you can replace dashes to space and use lower- or uppercase).
